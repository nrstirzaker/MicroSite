Ok. I think we can categories things in different ways but for the minute lets divide by self learning and group learning. This will just be a list, a starting point for further discussion

Group Learning
 There are a number of groups involved in teaching kids and adult about code and tech. These include

Stemettes (stemettes.org) - Anne Marie was one of the judges on the show
CoderDojo (coderDojo.com)
CodeClub (generally after school based, but also runs out of some libraries)
Young Rewired State - generally for more experienced coder, but very group community orientated
New one to me https://www.facebook.com/RobogalsUKEU, just started to laise with them
Meetup.com - this site covers every type of "hobby". however many are tech and/or entrepreneral focussed. Also a number of companies have created meetups as their social enterprise arm. another example is http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/
FreeFormers (they were on the program)
Raspberry Pi jams (https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/)
http://techmums.co/ Dr Sue Black - another judge runs this

Online/self taught

This is harder because the kid has to be self motivated, oftern parent just to a "I don;t get tech and leave them to it" :(

CodeAcademy (this are also running a Meetup
W3Schools

Not as of yet :( but we think that people are hungry for more and we can fill that. 

People all over the twitter are saying they’re inspired and occasionally asking for more info. The problem, however, is like Alex said: where do they go next?

Whilst the iron is hot, we figured it’s best to strike and put out some resources for those people to get cracking.

I'll compile a list,  then you can take a look and see if it's the right kind of stuff.  Are you getting lots of enquiries from people due to the TV program :)

They’d be the ones, Nigel. I think we might make this into an article and share it on our twitter too - so, anything for that sort of age will be helpful. Entry-level, young and mainly female.

Thanks an awful lot,

More than happy to.

Can you just confirm that you mean the "girls" from the TV show. Just that some of the resources I've got are school related which would not be appropriate obviously. Just lete me know and I'll send some links etc over by end of day

Hi Nigel,

Alex just forwarded me this email. Any chance you could suggest some resources for us? As Alex says, we’re pulling together resources for a list for the girls.

Thanks a lot,

Conor

Thanks Nigel

I am pulling together a list of resources for the girls on where they can access courses, communities, groups etc and I saw that you were part of CodeClub.

Conor is helping me pull this together today and I wondered if you could help by sending any links to good resources that you knew about?

Any help is appreciated

Thanks!
